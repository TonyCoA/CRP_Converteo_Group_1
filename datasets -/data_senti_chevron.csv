It‚Äôs our country.‚Äù They take an ‚Äúus versus them‚Äù attitude, as if ‚Äúthey‚Äù are coming in to steal our resources. We need to move away from the ‚Äúmy country, my oil‚Äù mindset. It‚Äôs wrong, and it‚Äôs hurting our industry and average people. We must be honest with ourselves and recognize that resource nationalism‚Äîa country‚Äôs efforts to maintain tight-¬≠fisted control of its resources‚Äîis just as bad as racism or sexism. 
I know they argue that it is OUR oil. It is true. But until we have the ability (technical and financial wherewithal) to extract our oil and gas like bp , Kosmos Energy , Woodside Energy Chevron ExxonMobil TotalEnergies , and others do, why are we adding roadblocks instead of incentivizing production? Sometimes, I think our governments simply ignore the fact that investors are spending a lot of money to make these projects work and that their successes will be, eventually, our own.
Xenophobic feelings about expatriates or foreigners coming into our countries to work infect the entire system. And that, in turn, affects the African people we want to protect and empower. Africans have been around the world, and we have marched and protested to be treated with decency and respect as human beings. 
When we operate from a mindset of resource nationalism, we bring the very attitude we have fought against to our own business dealings. We are less likely to create an enabling environment for investment, less likely to be transparent, less likely to develop effective local content policies, and less likely to benefit from knowledge-¬≠sharing, capacity building, and valuable public-¬≠private partnerships.

129,18/05/2024 13:46:02,"$XOM $CVX $SHEL $GALP.PL $TTE $BP $SEI.V World's Largest Oil Discovery in >10 Years is Up for Sale
(1) As XOM and CVX battle in international courts over the right to buy $HES 30% interest in Stabroek Block (Guyana), a ~40% interest in 9,890 sq km offshore block in Namibia (PEL 83) that produced the world‚Äôs largest oil discovery in >10 years is up for sale. Galp Energia‚Äôs first two exploration wells in PEL 83 produced a >10B boe discovery, Mopane. Galp is only a >$3B EBITDA company. It is too small to fund development of its 80% interest in PEL 83 and is looking for a larger partner to fund its development.
While future PEL 83 development costs will require tens of billions of USD, these are >20% IRR investments at Brent $70/bbl. PEL 83 is one of the few scalable oil projects in the world, and unlike Stabroek Block, it does not have an angry neighbor (Venezuela) claiming it. There should be numerous bidders on PEL 83 and the following is only SPECULATION of whom they will be.
(2) Before any additional discoveries, the Mopane discovery likely translates to 350k-400k bpd by the early 2030's, comparable to Diamondback Energy‚Äôs $FANG 357k liquids production in 2023 (current $40.7B Ent Value). Galp has confirmed plans to drill 4 new exploration and appraisal wells around its world-class Mopane discovery. Considering the additional 6 identified prospects north of Mopane, future production of 600k-800k bpd is within reason.
(3) As Exxon and Chevron battle over rights to Stabroek Block in Guyana, the two are also likely bidders for PEL 83 given their excellent financial resources, deepwater experience and strong balance sheets. Chevron will begin drilling exploration wells in PEL 90 (adjacent to PEL 83) in 4Q24/1Q25. Exxon‚Äôs balance sheet is underleveraged and could easily be used to fund both Guyana and Namibia oil projects.
Shell‚Äôs block in Namibia is also adjacent to PEL 83 and is likely headed toward development after its discoveries. Shell is experienced in deepwater, has financial resources and also curiously drilled the Cullinan-1 well in 2023, within very close proximity of Galp‚Äôs 80% of PEL 83.
TotalEnergies has a large development ahead of it in Namibia following its Venus and Mangetti discoveries, in addition to prospects in South Africa it will begin exploring in 2025. Also considering Total‚Äôs Suriname, Nigeria, Angola and LNG project pipeline, the French IOC likely already has a full menu of capital projects.
Angola-based Azule Energy (BP and Eni JV) could be an interested party after announcing a farm-out with Rhino Resources in Namibia shortly after the Mopane discovery. BP is potentially looking to replace reserves it lost via its Rosneft write-down in 2022. Other potential bidders include Equinor, Petrobras and CNOOC.
(4) A potential PEL 83 sale would likely be a 2025 event, as Galp and Chevron drill more exploration wells in late 2024 and Namibia‚Äôs general election is in November. Namibia‚Äôs state-oil company, NAMCOR, will likely retain its 10% interest. Custos Energy also owns 10% (Sintana owns 49% of Custos).

The rebound from the 2020 pandemic shockwave has resulted in a significant increase in free cash flow generation, reaching close to US$95 billion in 2022. However, due to factors such as the oil price drop and upstream spending strategy revisions, free cash flow levels are projected to drop to around US$55 billion in 2023 and stay relatively flat at just over US$52 billion in 2024. 
The top 10 companies for the years 2023 ‚Äì 2024 in terms of free cash flow generation in Africa include NOCs such as Algeria‚Äôs Sonatrach, NOC (Libya), Nigeria‚Äôs Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Limited (NNPC Ltd.), and Angola‚Äôs Sonangol, as well as majors like Eni, TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, BP, and Azule Energy.

----------------------------------------------
I discussed the prospects of Namibia's new oil and gas boom on @trtworld the other day. I am very optimistic about the country's socio-economic prospects.
1. Namibia is the ""new Guyana"" following a trio of significant play-opening oil discoveries in the Orange basin with the potential for up to 11 billion barrels of crude oil.
2. Buoyed by the country's political stability, high-impact drilling is expected to continue in Namibia.
3. Several majors such as Shell, TotalEnergies, Galp, Chevron, Azule Energy and ExxonMobil have acquired or are in the process of acquiring acreage.
4. Subject to FIDs, Namibia could produce between 500,000 to 1 million barrels a day by the mid-2030s. This would make it among the top five oil producers on the continent
5. Namibia is also looking to become a green industrial hub by producing green hydrogen for local, regional, and external markets in Europe. According to expert analysis,¬†Namibia¬†can theoretically produce some of the most cost-competitive¬†green hydrogen and green ammonia¬†globally using its vast solar and wind resources. In May 2023, Hyphen Hydrogen Energy agreed a deal with the Government of Namibia for a $10 billion green hydrogen project.
5. Namibia's US$13 billion GDP could double or even triple by 2040,¬†but the country would have to do more to translate this newfound resource wealth into equitable development and structural transformation--- governance/institutional reforms to address the large unemployment and inequality (NB: there are lots of good and bad lessons abound on the continent from Ghana to Nigeria).

However, according to media reports, other participants in the dinner have not commented on the allegations. Sheffield is paying the price for outspokenness and has become a victim of the efforts of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to take a tough stance on the industry. A major executive described the agency's approach as ""a little too much"".
Dan Pickering of Pickering Energy Partners, a consulting group, said:
There is no doubt that Sheffield has always been one of the spokespersons of the upstream oil industry in the United States, and it is obvious that he has received some criticism for this.
Considering the high-profile nature of this transaction, they need to take some action. I think many people who don't want the transaction to be successful will protest loudly if the transaction passes smoothly without any modification.
Some people believe that the Biden administration will make this move because it is worried about the impact of rising oil prices on the election. Some people in the industry are worried that considering that the FTC has collected a large number of documents and private communication records from energy companies during the merger and acquisition boom, the FTC will launch a broader, industry-wide survey on so-called ""collusion"" before the election.
In addition to the $60 billion Exxon-Pioneer transactions, the FTC also sent a second request for information to at least four other companies pending acquisitions, with a total value of more than $100 billion, mainly including:
Chevron and Hess; Diamond Back Energy and Endev Energy; Western Oil Company and Kronlock; Chesapeak Energy Company and Southwest Energy.

235,04/05/2024 13:58:16,"$GALP.PL $TDW $RIG $VAL $NE $SEI.V $TTE Offshore Macro Trending Positively
(1) Namibia Exploration Success: One of the top 3 things on my watch list for 2024 was Galp‚Äôs exploration results in Namibia. If floater dayrates get back to newbuild economics (>$700k/day) in coming years, exploration success in Namibia would play a large role. Galp‚Äôs initial results were outstanding. On 1Q24 earnings call, Galp stated, ‚ÄúWe found a much more prolific profile than we expected.‚Äù
Galp stated Mopane would be a ‚Äúmultiple FPSO development,‚Äù meaning multiple rigs would likely be needed to support both this new demand for development and ongoing exploration. Upstream reported last week Total is seeking a 180k FPSO for (Phase 1?) of its Venus discovery. Since the Mopane discovery in late April, Chevron acquired an 80% stake in PEL 82 and Azule (BP and Eni) acquired 42.5% of PEL 85 in Namibia.
Exxon‚Äôs Liza Phases 1 and 2 are two FPSO‚Äôs producing ~400k bpd. While very early, Mopane‚Äôs well results indicate a similar potential. Galp announced it will drill an additional 4 exploration and appraisal wells for Mopane and has more prospects to the north in PEL 83.
(2) While long-cycle tailwinds appear supportive of offshore capex, Transocean‚Äôs 1Q24 earnings reminded investors the oilfield services business can have its bumps. RIG‚Äôs Revenue Efficiency (converting backlog into revenues) was 92.9% in ~1Q, a disappointing print considering their 96.9% average in the prior 4 quarters (VAL deepwater averaging 93.8% since began reporting in ‚Äò23). This was likely an aberration for RIG.
(3) Steady Climb Higher: In a sign of underlying demand growth and discipline, 7G drillship dayrates are performing better than feared a few months ago. After Noble Viking at $499k, Deepwater Asgard at $505k and Deepwater Atlas (15k work) at $505k, the 7G drillship market has officially pierced the $500k/day threshold. Further, RIG stated on 1Q24 call it expects a few additional market wide awards in the Gulf of Mexico above $500k/day in the next few months. VAL also indicated mid-to-high $400k‚Äôs for term contracts globally, an indication of good underlying demand for current sidelined 7G drillship capacity (~10 floaters).
(4) Tidewater reported excellent results this week, benefiting from a strong Offshore Supply Vessel (OSV) market. Leading edge dayrates in Platform Supply Vessels (PSV) are now $30k after bottoming in low $10k‚Äôs in 2016-2021. PSV‚Äôs carry cargo to offshore drilling rigs, amongst other services. When compared to deepwater drillships and semisubmersible rigs, OSV‚Äôs generally work on shorter term contracts allowing them to capture dayrate appreciation faster. While drillships are much more expensive to build new (very unlikely this decade), OSV demand is expected to grow when the ~10 sidelined 7G drillships gradually return to work.

238,03/05/2024 22:28:24,"ISRAELI GENOCIDE WITH OIL FROM AZERBAIJAN, BRAZIL, EGYPT, GABON, GEORGIA, IRAQ, KAZAKHSTAN, RUSSIA, SAUDI ARABIA, TURKEY, THE UAE, AND THE US
First, a rhetorical question. Why is Israel's oil trade such a big, genocidal, deal? Because local supplies of crude oil are almost non-existent and because Israel's war effort would grind to an immediate halt without an assured supply of crude oil for its refineries and petroleum products such as military jet fuel that its refineries do not produce. The only reason Israel's blood-stained jets continue to operate is because the United States sent the necessary fuel tankers to Israel in the form of military aid. It is said that, except for what comes from America, all other supplies have disappeared.
But, Israel‚Äôs armed forces also uses large amounts of diesel fuel and gasoline for its tanks, bulldozers, and personnel carriers, which can be supplied by Israel‚Äôs own oil refineries, providing they receive uninterrupted supplies of crude oil from abroad. Fortunately for Israel, crude oil has been easy to obtain.
Since October 2023, Israel imported its crude oil from Azerbaijan through Georgia and Turkey, from Kazakhstan through Russia, and from Gabon and Brazil, with small amounts from the UAE, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia being routed through Egypt. Of these, Kazakhstan was the largest supplier and Azerbaijan the second largest. If either of these two countries would cease to export crude oil to Israel and if no other country took up the slack, then Israel's ability to wage a genocidal war of offense would come to a complete halt. If other countries joined in a boycott, Israel would be forced to negotiate an immediate, permanent, two-state, peace agreement with the Palestinians.
Companies supplying Israel with most of its crude oil and other petroleum imports are BP, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Eni, and TotalEnergies. In the case of Azerbaijan, its pipeline through Georgia and Turkey is owned by BP, Equinor, Eni, TotalEnergies and Exxon. BP also produces some of the oil in cooperation with SOCAR, an Azeri company.
Oil from Kazakhstan travels through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) Pipeline to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiisk. Chevron has the biggest investment. Exxon, Shell and Eni also have investments. These companies, plus Russian and Kazakh companies, own the Kazakh oil fields that are linked by the pipeline.
Only two shipments of Brazilian crude oil (260,000 tons) were exported indirectly to Israel since its invasion of Gaza. It was done with the cooperation of Shell, TotalEnergies and Petrobras, a Brazilian company. Compared with certain other countries, Brazil's ability to impose an embargo should be relatively easy, assuming Brazil's President Lula, unlike Turkey's President Erdogan, is willing to make good on his criticism of Israel.
Israel also receives small yet constant amounts of crude oil coming from Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE through Egypt where it is shipped from Alexandria. Russia also continues to send a regular supply of vacuum gas oil to a refinery in Haifa for being upgraded into gasoline and diesel fuel.
The Holocaust of the Palestinians, thus, is not merely an Israeli responsibility. It is the responsibility of the family of oil producing and transporting nations as a whole. It is, in the truest sense of the word, a family affair.

274,29/04/2024 11:19:08,"How much do stock buybacks matter? 
How does it work? 
Here's the lowdown in simple terms üëá
-Buybacks is effectively when a company uses cash to buy back its own shares on the open market
-It reduces total number of shares outstanding
-And your slice of the company gets bigger ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
For example:
-Company has $100 million in cash
-10 million shares outstanding
->Each share worth $10 (100m/10m)
If company does $20m buyback:
-2 million shares removed
-Now 8 million shares left
-Same $100m company value
->So each share now worth $12.50 (100m/8m)
Why do buybacks?
‚úîÔ∏èBullish signal - company thinks stock is undervalued
‚úîÔ∏èIncreases earnings per share
‚úîÔ∏èOffset dilution from executive compensation
But watch out: 
üö© Taking on debt to do buybacks is risky 
üö© Buybacks instead of investing for future growth 
üö© Inflating earnings per share artificially
‚è©The conclusion? 
Stock buybacks can be a good thing when a company genuinely believes its shares are undervalued and the buyback is funded by excess cash.
But they can also be a bad sign especially if a company is taking on debt to pursue buybacks instead of investing in future growth.

(1) After headline discoveries in Namibia by $TTE (Venus) and $SHEL (Graff), Galp‚Äôs Mopane exploration wells have been one of the key industry watches of 2024 since it announced the contracting of $SFL Hercules drilling rig in May 2023. While current Galp management has been tight lipped and professional, a FORMER Galp executive publicly stated he believed PEL 83 was the best ‚ÄúZIP code‚Äù in Namibia partly due to shallower water depth (~2,000m) than peers.
Last Sunday, Galp announced outstanding Mopane results of (1) >10 billion barrels of oil equivalent and (2) flows reaching ‚Äúmaximum allowed limits‚Äù during the well test. Without any further exploration success, I believe this translates to an eventual ~400k bpd oil development (~5 years to first oil). The development cost may be ~$25B, but with IRR‚Äôs comfortably >20% at $70 Brent. For the sake of comparison, $PXD Pioneer Natural Resources produced 372k barrels of oil per day (715k boepd) in 2023.
(2) Mopane ~400k bpd Capacity? Galp announced success hitting multiple layers of ‚Äúsignificant light oil columns‚Äù at Mopane-1 and Mopane-2 with ‚Äúgood porosities, high pressures and high permeabilities.‚Äù ExxonMobil‚Äôs Liza-1 and Liza-2 wells in Guyana‚Äôs Stabroek Block were drilled 8 km apart, a similar distance between Mopane-1 and Mopane-2. Today, Liza Phase 1 (~150k bpd) and Liza Phase 2 (~250k bpd) produce ~400k bpd in Guyana.
(3) Galp is rumored to be interested in drilling up to an additional 10 exploration and appraisal wells in PEL 83. As noted below, PEL 83 has additional prospects (Source: Sintana Energy, 4.9% interest in PEL 83). While offshore exploration is inherently risky, Total and Shell had oil discoveries beyond Venus and Graff in their respective blocks. Also, Galp publicly disclosed a ‚Äúnear-term‚Äù drilling plan to further explore and appraise the Mopane complex. Given the other identified targets and the Mopane success, I believe another discovery of ~150k bpd capacity potential is probable (my Base Case) although would not be explored until 2025.
(4) Long-Term Leading Indicator of Floater and OSV Demand: Exploration success in Namibia is very likely to lead to strong, durable demand growth for floaters and OSV‚Äôs. The demand growth should be gradual given deepwater‚Äôs long-cycle nature, but especially strong from 2026-2032. Shortly after Galp‚Äôs Mopane discovery announcement, Rhino Resources hired Noble‚Äôs Venturer drillship to drill two wells in their block. Additionally, Chevron will likely begin exploration drilling in PEL 90 in late 2024. Further, Upstream reported $TTE is rumored to target a 180k bpd capacity FPSO for likely Venus development (Phase 1?).
$RIG $VAL $TDW $ODL.OL $NE $SDRL $DO In 2023, a test of my confidence in the offshore thesis was future exploration drilling in Namibia. The deepwater floater market is trending positively, but needs to clear a modest amount sidelined drillship capacity. In order to get to longer term leading edge dayrates of $600k, it needs incremental demand growth from exploration success and we're currently seeing it in Namibia, as well as other countries.",neutral,152,20,9800,15820,1265,Chevron,0.25566017627716064,neutral

371,20/04/2024 13:45:41,"$NOL.OL $TTE $RIG $SHEL $VAL $ODL.OL $SDRL Deepwater M&A Prospect, ""Good Assets, Bad Balance Sheet"" 
(1) Northern Ocean (‚ÄúNOL‚Äù) was created to purchase two stranded newbuild UDW HE Semisubs, Deepsea Mira and Deepsea Bollsta in 2018-2019. Both meet Norway's high standards and are marketable across the world. Despite recent stronger market conditions for UDW HE Semisubs compared to Drillships, NOL‚Äôs balance sheet, near-term maturities, liquidity and uncontracted ‚Äúwhite space‚Äù have contributed to NOL‚Äôs financial vulnerability that has dragged its equity performance lower in 2024. Both Mira and Bollsta are high spec rigs with similar designs to RIG's Norge and Odjfell‚Äôs Deepsea Nordkapp UDW HE Semisubs. At 4/19/23 valuations, NOL is $329mm per UDW HE Semisub rig compared to an estimated ~$1B newbuild cost per rig. UDW HE Semisub pure-play $ODL.OL is +30.7% YTD, while $NOL.OL is -13.3% YTD. Odfjell‚Äôs semisubs are 100% contracted for years to come, while Northern Ocean‚Äôs semisubs are uncontracted in 2025.
(2) NOL an M&A Target? $TTE acquired 75% of the Tungsten Explorer drillship in February 2024 from a financially vulnerable Vantage Drilling as an innovative step to control costs. Considering Mira and Bollsta are working in Namibia, Total may be interested for Venus discovery but is likely a low bid. Odfjell Drilling may be an interested acquirer as they manage both Mira and Bollsta, although do not present an obvious cash solution for NOL's $390mm of bank debt due in January 2025. $RIG stated they would use proceeds from their recent $1.8B bond offering to tender outstanding debt, although have cash remaining after their initial tender offers. Transocean ‚Äúkicked the tires‚Äù on Bollsta in 2017, though chose not to purchase due to additional capital investment needs and the mobilization fee. Northern Ocean eventually acquired Bollsta and was delivered in June 2019.
(3) Hemen Holding, indirectly controlled by John Fredriksen, owns 39% of NOL. Also, a related entity Sterna has loaned $151mm to NOL to support their liquidity. The majority of NOL‚Äôs $54mm cash at 12/31/2023 is likely to go toward the upcoming SPS for Deepsea Bollsta when its contract with Shell concludes this June. Further straining NOL‚Äôs liquidity, its $390mm term loans are floating rate. SOFR rising 500 bps in the last 24 months has contributed to nearly $20mm/year in higher interest costs.
(4) Mira and Bollsta are both located in Namibia where there has been substantial deepwater exploration success. While Total and Shell appear likely toward developing, Galp Energia‚Äôs recent success in PEL 83 with Mopane-1 and Mopane-2 exploration wells likely indicates future demand from them, as well as Chevron likely embarking on an exploration campaign in PEL 90 within the next 12 months. When SFL‚Äôs Hercules leaves for Canada, Namibia will only have 3 deepwater rigs, an amount that could reasonably double or triple in coming years.

397,14/04/2024 15:27:48,"Unmasking Fossil Fuel Disinformation: Top 5 Tactics Exposed"" highlights the sophisticated and well-funded disinformation campaigns orchestrated by the fossil fuel industry to cast doubt on climate change and delay meaningful action. The Guardian and other sources have recently shared insights into these tactics, aiming to help the public and journalists navigate the climate change discussion more effectively.
Here are the top 5 tactics:
Amplifying Uncertainty: Fossil fuel companies often emphasize the uncertainties in climate science, even though the scientific consensus is overwhelmingly clear. This tactic aims to create doubt and confusion among the public.
Promoting False Solutions: The industry frequently promotes ""solutions"" that do not address the root causes of climate change, such as carbon capture and storage, while downplaying the importance of reducing fossil fuel consumption.
Funding Opposition: The fossil fuel industry funds organizations and individuals who oppose climate action, providing them with resources to spread their message. This includes think tanks, advocacy groups, and even some politicians.
Greenwashing: Companies engage in ""greenwashing"" by promoting their efforts to reduce emissions or invest in renewable energy, while continuing to expand fossil fuel production. This creates a misleading image of their environmental commitment.
Targeting Vulnerable Communities: The industry often targets low-income and minority communities with disinformation campaigns, exploiting their economic vulnerability to gain support for fossil fuel projects.
To spot these tactics, it's essential to be aware of the sources of information and their potential biases. It's also important to critically evaluate the claims made and look for evidence to support them. By understanding these tactics, we can better navigate the disinformation landscape and make informed decisions about climate change and the actions needed to address it.

422,10/04/2024 19:28:03,"BREAKING NEWS
The state of mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures in the oil and gas industry reflects a dynamic landscape influenced by various factors both globally and within the United States. In the upstream segment, oil and gas majors have been actively pursuing acquisitions, with notable players like Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum leading the charge. These acquisitions, which accounted for a significant portion of total deal value in the energy, natural resources, and chemicals sectors, have primarily focused on securing assets in strategic locations such as West Texas, North Dakota, and Guyana's coast. The midstream and downstream segments are witnessing a mix of consolidation and strategic divestments, particularly in response to evolving market dynamics and regulatory shifts. Mergers and acquisition deals, however, face hurdles due to valuation gaps and uncertainties surrounding capital returns from existing investments.
Globally, the oil market outlook is characterized by cautious optimism amid ongoing OPEC+ production cuts, leading to reduced forecasts for global oil production growth in 2024. This reduction in growth, coupled with falling inventories, is expected to drive up Brent crude oil spot prices. In the United States, retail gasoline prices are projected to rise, largely driven by higher crude oil prices, while natural gas prices are expected to remain relatively low.
On Monday, April 15, 2024, I will be joining with the Federal Reserve Bank and leading experts in energy and finance to discuss insights about the unfolding dynamics and the transaction opportunities they present.

448,06/04/2024 16:10:15,"VENEZUELA - THE RISE & FALL
Venezuela, home to the world‚Äôs largest oil reserves, is a case study in the perils of becoming a petrostate. Since it was discovered in the country in the 1920s, oil has taken Venezuela on an exhilarating but dangerous boom-and-bust ride that offers lessons for other resource-rich states. Decades of poor governance have driven what was once one of Latin America‚Äôs most prosperous countries to economic and political ruin.
In recent years, Venezuela has suffered economic collapse, with output shrinking significantly and rampant hyperinflation contributing to a scarcity of basic goods, such as food and medicine. Meanwhile, government mismanagement and U.S. sanctions have led to a drastic decline in oil production and severe underinvestment in the sector.
Venezuela is the archetype of a failed petrostate (Petrostate is an informal term used to describe a country where: government income is deeply reliant on the export of oil and natural gas; economic and political power are highly concentrated in an elite minority & political institutions are weak and unaccountable, and corruption is widespread). 
A number of grim indicators tell the story:
- Oil dependence: In recent years, oil exports have financed almost two-thirds of the government‚Äôs budget
- Falling production: Starved of adequate investment and maintenance, oil output has continued to generally decline
- Turbulent economy: Venezuela‚Äôs gross domestic product (GDP) shrank
- Soaring debt: Venezuela has an estimated debt burden of more than $150 billion
- Hyperinflation: Annual inflation skyrocketed to just over 130,000% in 2018, and though it has since slowed, it remained at 360% in 2023
How did Venezuela get here
A number of economic and political milestones mark Venezuela‚Äôs path as a petrostate:
- Discovering oil: In 1922, Royal Dutch Shell geologists at La Rosa, a field in the Maracaibo Basin, struck oil, which blew out at what was then an extraordinary rate of one hundred thousand barrels per day. In a matter of years, more than one hundred foreign companies were producing oil, backed by dictator General Juan Vicente G√≥mez (1908‚Äì1935). Annual production exploded during the 1920s from just over a million barrels to 137 million, making Venezuela second only to the United States in total output by 1929. By the time G√≥mez died in 1935, Dutch disease had settled in: the Venezuelan bol√≠var had ballooned, and oil shoved aside other sectors to account for over 90% of total exports
- Reclaiming oil rents: By the 1930s, just three foreign companies - Gulf, Royal Dutch Shell & Standard Oil - controlled 98% of the Venezuelan oil market. G√≥mez‚Äôs successors sought to reform the oil sector to funnel funds into government coffers. The Hydrocarbons Law (requiring foreign companies to give half of their oil profits to the state) of 1943 was the first step in that direction
- Punto Fijo pact: In 1958, after a succession of military dictatorships, Venezuela elected its first stable democratic government. That year, Venezuela‚Äôs three major political parties signed the Punto Fijo pact (which guaranteed that state jobs and, notably, oil rents would be parcelled out to the three parties in proportion to voting results). While the pact sought to guard against dictatorship and usher in democratic stability, it ensured that oil profits would be concentrated in the state
- The 1970s boom: In 1973, a five-month OPEC embargo on countries backing Israel in the Yom Kippur War quadrupled oil prices and made Venezuela the country with the highest per-capita income in Latin America
- The 1980s oil glut: As global oil prices plummeted in the 1980s, Venezuela‚Äôs economy contracted and inflation soared; at the same time, it accrued massive foreign debt by purchasing foreign refineries (such as Citgo in the United States)
- Ch√°vez‚Äôs Bolivarian revolution: Ch√°vez was elected president in 1998 on a socialist platform, pledging to use Venezuela‚Äôs vast oil wealth to reduce poverty and inequality. While his costly ‚ÄúBolivarian missions‚Äù expanded social services and cut poverty by 20%, he also took several steps that precipitated a long and steady decline in the country‚Äôs oil production, which peaked in the late 1990s and early 2000s
- Descent into dictatorship: In mid-2014, global oil prices tumbled and Venezuela‚Äôs economy went into free fall. As unrest brewed, Maduro consolidated power through political repression, censorship, and electoral manipulation. In 2018, he secured re-election in a race widely condemned as unfair and undemocratic
The impact of U.S. sanctions
For almost two decades, Washington has imposed sweeping sanctions against Caracas, the most significant of which have blocked oil imports & prevented the government from accessing the U.S. financial system. In November 2022, in part to help offset rising global energy prices due to the war in Ukraine, the United States permitted U.S. oil giant Chevron to resume limited operations in the country. In exchange, the Maduro government and the opposition agreed to continue dialogue following a yearlong stalemate. The following October, Caracas agreed to a roadmap for a free and fair presidential election in 2024. Washington rewarded the move by further easing sanctions on Venezuela‚Äôs oil and gas sector, allowing it to export oil and gas products for six months But the government‚Äôs failure to meet conditions for a fair vote ...",negative,4,1,9561,9862,788,Chevron,-0.27984216064214706,neutral

Chatham House, also known as the Royal Institute of International Affairs, is a British think tank based in London, England. It was founded in 1920 and is dedicated to the study of international affairs. Chatham House's mission is to help governments and societies build a sustainably secure, prosperous, and just world. The organization is known for its independent analysis, trusted dialogue, and influential ideas.
Chatham House is the originator of the Chatham House Rule, which is a principle for holding debates and discussions under a rule that allows participants to use the information received, but without revealing the identity or affiliation of the speaker. This rule is intended to promote open and honest discussions on important issues.
The think tank has been involved in various research and events related to global issues, including climate change, international security, and global development. For example, they hosted an event where the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) spoke about the actions needed to address climate change.
Chatham House is a membership-based organization that includes individuals, organizations, and corporations. Members have access to a range of benefits, including invitations to events, access to research publications, and opportunities to engage in discussions with experts in international affairs.
The organization has a rich history and has played a significant role in shaping global discourse on international relations. It continues to be a leading voice in the field of international affairs, providing analysis and ideas to help address global challenges.
The Founding
The Royal Institute of International Affairs, known as Chatham House, was established in 1920. It received the Grade-I listed 18th-century building, Chatham House, as a gift in 1923. The Chatham House Rule, which is a principle for holding debates and discussions under a rule that allows participants to use the information received, but without revealing the identity or affiliation of the speaker, was created in June 1927. The rule was later modified in 1992 and 2002.
Who founded Chatham House?
The Royal Institute of International Affairs, commonly known as Chatham House, was founded in 1920. It was founded by a group of individuals, primarily by Lionel Curtis, with assistance from individuals like Lord Robert Cecil and members of the British Foreign Office.
Lionel Curtis
Lionel George Curtis (1872‚Äì1955) was a British public administrator, author, and advocate of British imperial federalism and a world state. He was born in Little Eaton, Derbyshire, England, on March 7, 1872. Curtis played a significant role in the development of the Commonwealth of Nations and had considerable influence on international politics.
In 1910, Curtis founded the Round Table, a quarterly journal, to propagate his ideas about Liberal imperialism. He was appointed Beit lecturer in colonial history at the University of Oxford in 1912, and in 1920, he helped found the organization that became the Royal Institute of International Affairs, commonly known as Chatham House.
 He authored several books, including ""The Commonwealth of Nations"" (1916), ""Dyarchy"" (1920), and ""Civitas Dei: The Commonwealth of God"" (1938). In ""Civitas Dei,"" Curtis argued that the United States should rejoin the British Commonwealth and that the Commonwealth should evolve into a world government.
Lord Robert Cecil 
Lord Robert Cecil, also known as the 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood, CH, PC, QC (14 September 1864 ‚Äì 24 November 1958), was a British lawyer, politician, and diplomat. He is best known for his role as one of the architects of the League of Nations.
His efforts in promoting international peace and cooperation were recognized when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1937.
Lord Robert Cecil was born as Edgar Algernon Robert Gascoyne-Cecil in London, England. He was educated at University College, Oxford, where he became well known for his debating skills. In 1887, he was admitted to the Bar and practiced as a barrister until 1906. He was appointed as a Queen's Counsel in 1899.
League of Nations
The League of Nations was an international organization established after World War I with the aim to prevent future wars and promote international cooperation. It was founded in 1920 as a result of the Paris Peace Conference, which was convened to negotiate peace treaties following the First World War. The League's founding members included 42 countries, with notable absences being the United States, which did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles, and Germany, which was initially excluded but later joined in 1926.
Despite its noble intentions and some significant achievements, the League of Nations ultimately failed in its primary goal to prevent another world war. It was unable to prevent the aggression of Italy, Germany, and Japan in the late 1930s, which eventually led to the outbreak of World War II. 
The League of Nations was officially dissolved in April 1946, and its functions and responsibilities were transferred to the newly formed United Nations. 
The League of Nations, established after World War I, was a precursor to several modern international organizations like NATO, the UN, and the WEF.
Round Table Movement
The Round Table Movement was a political organization founded in 1909 with the aim of strengthening the British Empire by promoting closer union among Britain and its self-governing colonies, such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. It was particularly active in imperial affairs during the early 20th century. The movement was conceived as a means to ensure the continued unity and strength of the British Empire while also encouraging the development of a ""Commonwealth of free 'British' nations.""
The Round Table Movement was inspired by the ideas of Cecil Rhodes and Lord Milner, who were key figures in British imperial policy at the time. They envisioned a global network of political elites working towards a unified Anglo-Saxon political and economic order. 
The Round Table Movement was instrumental in the establishment of two influential think tanks: Chatham House in London and the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. 
The Council on Foreign Relations
The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) is an independent, nonpartisan think tank and publisher dedicated to promoting understanding of international relations and foreign policy. It was founded in 1921 and is headquartered in New York City.

‚ÄúWe are moving away from fossil fuels ‚Äî and we are not turning back,‚Äù Kerry declared at the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Dubai.
But three months later, it appears that some of the world‚Äôs biggest oil and gas companies did not get the memo. At an energy conference here this week, their leaders struck a much different tone, predicting that fossil fuels will continue to power the global economy well into the future.
‚ÄúWe should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas,‚Äù Amin Nasser, president and CEO of Saudi Aramco, said to applause at CERAWeek by S&P Global.
Shell CEO Wael Sawan declared that ‚Äúthere is going to be a multidimensional energy system in the future, [and] oil and gas will continue to have an important role in stabilizing that system for a long, long, long time to come.‚Äù
And Patrick Pouyann√©, CEO of the French energy giant TotalEnergies, said he was ‚Äúquite pleased‚Äù that the Dubai deal recognized ‚Äúthat we need some transition fuels, and gas is one of them.‚Äù
It‚Äôs hardly surprising that oil industry executives would see a continued role for their products, even as the world shifts to cleaner fuels to fight climate change. But their remarks underscored an uncomfortable reality for climate advocates and policymakers globally: Demand for oil keeps rising, delaying the end of the fossil fuel era.
The industry executives‚Äô pronouncements are backed up by record oil-and-gas production and consumer misgivings over purchasing electric vehicles. At the same time, utilities are rushing to line up more natural gas to meet explosive power demand fueled by electricity-hungry data centers.
President Biden‚Äôs top climate officials face another uncomfortable fact: The United States is now pumping more oil than any other country in history. U.S. crude oil production averaged 12.9 million barrels per day in 2023, breaking the previous record of 12.3 million barrels per day set in 2019.
Big Oil and its investors are reaping the rewards. ExxonMobil and Chevron, the largest U.S. energy companies, reported their biggest annual profits in a decade last year. Exxon reported $36 billion in earnings, while Chevron netted $21.4 billion.
Nasser projected that global oil demand will reach a new record of 104 million barrels per day this year, despite the growth of electric vehicles and wind and solar energy. He rejected the International Energy Agency‚Äôs forecast that oil consumption will peak in 2030. (The coalition of oil-producing nations led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, known as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has also criticized the IEA‚Äôs forecast as unrealistic.)

Report: #SaudiArabia is involved in supplying the Israeli occupation with fuel during the Gaza war. 
A report prepared by the ‚ÄúOil Change International‚Äù research organization revealed the involvement of Saudi Arabia and other countries in supplying the Israeli occupation with fuel that fuels its war machines, which continue to crush the Gaza Strip for the sixth month in a row.
The report stressed ‚Äúthe devastating role of oil in fueling the ongoing genocide against the Palestinian people,‚Äù noting that ‚Äúcountries and companies whose fuel supplies are perpetuating the humanitarian crisis in Gaza have an opportunity to help impose a ceasefire by closing those taps.‚Äù
The report explained that the United States is at the top of the list of major oil exporters to the Israeli occupation army to supply aircraft with fuel.
He pointed out that Brazil and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are involved in supplying the occupying state with the necessary fuel for its war machine, noting that ""Israel receives relatively small but regular shipments of crude oil through the SUMED pipeline, which receives crude oil from Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Iraq and Egypt.""
According to the site, major oil companies, including BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, Eni, and TotalEnergies, are also complicit in fueling atrocities in their ownership stakes and operations in projects that supply oil to Israel, especially through Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan.
The report noted that ""countries and companies that continue to provide fuel to Israel play a role in enabling ongoing violence and oppression against the Palestinian people.""
The director of the International Oil Change Program in the United States, Allie Rosenbluth, was quoted as saying, ‚ÄúThe countries and major oil companies that feed the Israeli war machine are complicit in the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people,‚Äù adding that ‚Äúby directly supplying fuel to the Israeli army, in addition to more Of the 100 other arms sales, the United States in particular should be held accountable for potential violations of international law.‚Äù
Rosenbluth called on ""countries to take advantage of their oil supplies as a means to demand an immediate ceasefire and an end to the occupation,"" explaining that fossil fuel companies, such as BP, Chevron, and Exxon, which are driven solely by profit, are prepared to fuel the conflict against innocent civilians. This must stop today.""
The report also quoted the General Coordinator of the Palestinian National Committee to Boycott Israel, Mahmoud Al-Nawajaa, as saying, ‚ÄúThe International Court of Justice ruling issued on January 26 indicates that Israel could commit genocide against 2.3 million Palestinians in occupied Gaza. States and companies must To put an immediate end to any complicity in the acts of genocide committed by Israel.‚Äù
For the 161st day in a row, the occupation continues to commit massacres as part of the genocidal war it is waging against the people of the Gaza Strip, targeting inhabited homes and medical and journalistic teams.
The death toll from the ongoing aggression on the Gaza Strip rose to more than 31,000 martyrs, and more than 72,000 injured with various injuries, in addition to thousands missing under the rubble, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza.

(1) $CVX $53B acquisition of $HES in October 2023, which includes Hess‚Äô crucial 30% stake in Guyana‚Äôs offshore Stabroek Block, is contested by incumbent $XOM, citing a right of first refusal in the Stabroek block joint operating agreement. Chevron/Hess argue their merger‚Äôs structure makes Exxon‚Äôs claim irrelevant. This fight between oil majors for the right to invest tens of billions of dollars in Guyana signifies substantial value, although recent major oil discoveries in Namibia rival those found in Guyana.
(2) Namibia‚Äôs ‚ÄúSkeleton Coast‚Äù: The Benguela Current contributes to difficult conditions in Namibia for ships due to dense fog and strong currents, leading to reduced visibility and navigational challenges that have historically resulted in numerous shipwrecks along the Skeleton Coast‚Äôs inhospitable shoreline. The unfriendly seas of Namibia previously prioritized other parts of the world for deepwater exploration, although 3D seismic and special rigs designed for harsh Norwegian North Sea conditions have helped Namibia become the global hotspot for oil exploration.
(3) Deepwater Guyana is a benign offshore market where drillships are best designed to work. Due to the harsh Benguela current, Namibia is ‚Äúharsh environment‚Äù offshore waters where drillships are less capable. Harsh Environment (‚ÄúHE‚Äù) Semisubs were designed to work in the rough waters of Norway, although as global offshore oil exploration has expended in recent years, the HE Semisubs have played a key role in exploration drilling the ultradeep harsh waters of Namibia. 
Substantial discoveries in the Namibian Orange Basin by TotalEnergies (Venus), Shell (Graff) and now Galp (Mopane) have drawn comparisons to Guyana‚Äôs Stabroek block, with future exploration activity potentially making Namibia even larger. Comments from two major global oil company executives thus far include, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs massive‚Äù and the oil flows ‚Äúlike a train.‚Äù While Total, Shell and Galp appear headed toward developing their separate blocks, Chevron, Woodside and others have yet to drill their first exploration well.
(4) After initial discovery in 2016, current resource estimates in Guyana are >11 Billion BOE (Source: Hess). While discoveries in Namibia took until 2022-2023 to be found, TotalEnergies‚Äô and Shell‚Äôs resources are likely 3-5 Billion BOE to date (very unofficial, rough estimate) with substantial exploration still to come. Little known Portuguese oil company Galp Energia is engaged in the most exciting current exploration campaign in PEL 83. In January, Galp‚Äôs Mopane-1X well encountered ‚Äútwo significant light oil columns.‚Äù Galp‚Äôs Mopane-2X well is currently being drilled with results likely announced in a few weeks. Surrounded by oil giants in Namibia, depending on exploration results Galp may be the Hess of Namibia and will likely have to find a partner for its 80% interest in PEL 83. Chevron is expected to begin exploring PEL 90 in the next 12 months with Australian Woodside to do the same on the ‚ÄúSaturn Superfan‚Äù in PEL 87 in 2025. Sintana Energy owns minority interests in PEL 83, PEL 90 and PEL 87 and provides the Namibia exploration map to the left that I have borrowed 4 times now.",neutral,159,16,9180,13996,1119,Chevron,0.053265783935785294,neutral

The government has put a windfall tax on the profits that oil and gas companies make from the North Sea. However, it has included the ability to reduce the tax if the companies invest, something the opposition has called a ‚Äúloophole‚Äù.
A year ago BP made an $8.45bn (¬£6.6bn) profit when it was boosted by a surge in oil and gas prices.
Natural gas was trading at around 320p per therm a year ago, now it is worth around 70p per therm.
Yet it still revealed plans to hand more cash to investors through higher dividends and a further share buyback.
BP Spokesperson 
we‚Äôre delivering for shareholders, growing our dividend and announcing a further share buyback.‚Äù
Shares in BP were up around 2 per cent 
The big oil companies - from the UK-based BP and Shell to international giants such as ExxonMobil and Norway‚Äôs Equinor - have been announcing astonishing profit figures.
They are all benefitting from the surging price of oil and gas following the invasion of Ukraine.
While they rake in the profits, people around the world are struggling to pay their energy bills and fill up their cars - leading to calls for higher taxes on these companies.
The world‚Äôs five largest listed oil companies are expected to reward their investors with record payouts of more than $100bn (¬£79bn) for 2023 against a backdrop of growing public outrage at fossil fuel profits.
The five ‚Äúsuper-majors‚Äù ‚Äì BP, Shell, Chevron,¬†ExxonMobil¬†and TotalEnergies ‚Äì showered shareholders with dividend payments and share buybacks worth $104bn in the 2022 calendar year, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).

Lawmaker representing Kogi Central and the Chairman, Senate Committee on Local Content, Senator Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan has charged Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) to make funding opportunities accessible to ordinary Nigerians while uncovering $400m intervention funds domiciled in some financial institutions for couple of years.
Out of the intervention funds uncovered, $50m was budgeted for capacity building in oil and gas ($30m) and women in oil and gas businesses ($20m), respectively.
Another $50m of Local content development fund available for Research and Development in oil and gas industries was also domiciled in Central Bank of Nigeria.
These funds, according to her, will attract oil and gas equipment manufacturers to NOGaPS facilities, as well as increase access to affordable finance by the manufacturing entities, adding that the board should explain to Nigerians who are not aware of the availability of the fund how they can access it. 
The Local Content Chairman during her interactive session with management of NCDMB on Wednesday, specifically lamented that while Chevron apart from crude oil exploration in Saudi Arabia, also manufactures Polypropylene (one of the waste products from Gas) to produce Syringe which fetches Saudi Arabia $6billion annually.
She further blamed the collapse of Jubilee Syringe Plant in Bayelsa on the lacuna in the operational model of the International Oil companies.
As part of its oversight functions, the committee mandated the management to submit the audited account of NCDMB from 2021 to 2022, the budgetary performances of 2022 and 2023, and the nominal roll of the Board. 
In his remarks, the Executive Secretary of NCDMB, Engr Felix Ogbo revealed that 300 million dollars meant for Nigeria Content Intervention Fund is still domiciled in Bank of Industry.
According to the board, the entire 300 million dollars has been disbursed. The board added that the total amount disbursed so far amounts to 330 million dollars, explaining that as beneficiaries pay, the money would be given to others who want to borrow.
The management added that five companies out of the seventy companies that accessed the fund have fully repaid the loan and it has been efficient and successful. 
The management disclosed that the only challenge was during COVID-19 when there was a global economic shutdown and the board interacted with the BoI managing the fund, to give the companies palliative of two years moratorium to enable companies recover from the effect of the pandemic.
""Bank of Industry carries out quarterly monitoring to ensure the companies use the loan for the purpose it was meant for. We also carry out joint annual project monitoring with the Bank of Industry,"" Ogbo said. 
Senator Natasha, however, noted that the oil and gas sector cannot work in isolation of other sectors, calling for synergy amongst them. 
She tasked the management of the board to interact with the international oil companies operating in Nigeria on how to establish manufacturing companies in the country through the use of byproduct of gas like polypropylene for the manufacturing of syringe, protective wares and other products instead of making Nigeria just extracting hub. 
""I am glad that quite a number of various committee chairmen were here, and everyone is all passionate and committed on the same goal to grow Nigeria, to grow capacity in product and services that will support not only the oil and gas but in turn other critical sectors that will be stimulated.
‚ÄùWe cannot just allow the oil companies to turn Nigeria into just an extractive zone as far as exploration of crude oil is concerned but a manufacturing one as well with attendant economic value.",neutral,213,55,1266310,1282865,102629,Chevron,0.03621703386306763,neutral

His black ministerial Mercedes Benz was parked near Kingston Bookshop along Kwame Nkrumah Avenue. The late Masvingo Zanu-PF kingpin looked dapper and sharp and larger than life as he puffed on a cigarette by the pavement.
I was surprised to see him appear cool and calm and collected in a public spot. Cabinet ministers breathed rarefied air back then and lived aloof from the very people whose lives depended on their actions and decisions. However I had heard that Minister Zvobgo loved to meet and talk with commoners at Chevron Hotel in Masvingo. So I had one million questions for him that day. And yet for all my juvenile ambition I was awed by his presence and mindful of two mean-looking bodyguards near him ‚Äì so much so ‚Äì I hesitated and walked on when presented with half a chance to pick his famed intellectual brains.
But that was the real problem. I had buckled under the strain of built-up anxiety and fear and remained crushed and dwarfed by the bizarrely false independence-era belief that you cannot hobnob with Cabinet ministers and ask them difficult questions about critical national matters. I simply wanted to know why Minister Zvobgo had crafted the executive presidency.
But even before that constitutional disaster came along Zimbabwe had been a very fearsome and inhibitory society. I remember how I often spent holidays at Kamativi Tin Mine in Matabeleland North. My aunt Resca worked as a nurse at the mine hospital and enjoyed inviting family members over. I had wonderful friends in Kamativi. Like Munyaradzi: his mother hailed from Mashonaland while his father was Ndebele. Munyaradzi and I really had fun. We would play at the mine compound and shops and wander around aimlessly each and every day.
Whenever Munyaradzi was not around I used to get around the mine on my own speaking a combination of English and Shona without a problem at all. I really loved the place. I really loved the people. And I really loved the journey from Harare to Kamativi ‚Äì especially when I took the train to Bulawayo along with my elder niece ‚Äì since I enjoyed drinking coffee and eating snacks on the train. Uncharacteristically I also loved the bus ride from Bulawayo to Kamativi and treasured passing through places like Lupane district.
It was all so lovely and normal and tranquil and the mine itself was a beautiful labour of construction. My aunt Resca had a nice little company house which was located on a small hill near the shops. She stayed in Kamativi for so long my youngest niece learnt to speak fluent Ndebele. Later she would marry a Ndebele man and open up a whole new world for us all and our Ndebele in-laws.
I have nonetheless never been able to view my brother-in-law through ethnic eyes. I have never been to label my friends using regional locations. I have never put any credence to where they were born and the languages they speak. I have also learnt to avoid the discriminatory friends I had in the past and maintain very few fair-minded acquaintances.
Because while I was young and enjoying my childhood in Kamativi ‚Äì Gukurahundi was well underway in parts of Matabeleland. All the while nobody ever treated me badly in Kamativi. Nobody threatened me. Nobody hurt me. Nobody made me feel unwelcome. I was treated like any other child and never felt unloved and unwanted wherever I went. I would not have spent so many holidays there were that not the case. So how was I to know about cruel civilian deaths elsewhere when there was a total media blackout on the deadly matter?
But when I was older and knew better and the Internet came alive I downloaded a report on the Catholic Church investigation into Gukurahundi. It is such a graphic and horrific report of the brutal terror that the Perence Shiri-led Fifth Brigade carried out reading it sends shivers up and down one‚Äôs spine. Tribal-based animosity and conflict did not however end when the horrendous hostilities ceased and the Unity Accord was signed in 1987. In the aftermath of the low-level war many Shona racists have found fertile grounds to continually sow the seeds of tribalism in Zimbabwe.
I have heard a lot of inane fallacies about how and why Gukurahundi happened. I have heard seemingly normal and rational people routinely infer that the Ndebele people caused Gukurahundi and deserved to suffer and die for it. I have heard incredibly reckless statements about how Ndebele people pretend not to speak Shona. Yet I have so many excellent friends who happen to be Ndebele and have never expected them to speak Shona. They are my friends and not language experts and I do not speak Ndebele anyway. Maybe if I had learnt Ndebele alongside Shona at school I would speak several languages now.
I do not tolerate prejudice in any context and consciously avoid people who are racial bigots. I appreciate all manner of people and work hard to maintain a healthy mind and transparent approach towards cultural diversity. I have in-laws who are Zulu and that too has been a wonderful experience.
So I would have loved to know what the Harvard-trained Zvobgo thought about Gukurahundi. Did he have a legal opinion and personal position on the awful tragedy? Did he believe that military officials should face prosecution for the tragedy? Did he believe in the establishment of a truth and reconciliation and compensation process for the victims of Gukurahundi and their loved ones? I feel for the people who lost family and friends in utterly inhumane circumstances. Zimbabwe must reach out and let them know that all broadminded humanitarians feel their pain still.
Which is why Zimbabwe should offer an unreserved and wholehearted apology to the affected families and Matabeleland regions. I hope that the unreasonable fear that flourishes in social and political spaces will perish forever. I also hope that contemporary divisions between regular people and wealthy elected representatives will somehow be substituted with confidence-building actions and accountability and profound prosperity for all. I truthfully hope for an equal society where nobody from Matabeleland feels foreign and left out because of historic injustices and social and economic discrimination.
I cannot remember when I made my final journey to Kamativi. But I remember the warmth and sunshine that overwhelmed the small mining town like I was there yesterday. Low tin prices led to the closure of the mine in 1994. Yet the humble and wonderful people in Kamativi had opened my world to the abundant richness of common humanity. Zimbabwe must have a million melting pots like Kamativi. Places where real unity rises above politics and public posturing. Places where people relish a multicultural society and care for each other without callous expectation of mainstream recognition or a round of public applause. Places that you and I will always feel happy and proud to call home.",neutral,0,0,859,859,68,Chevron,0.4342652577906847,neutral

Ten senators, including those on critical committees involved in climate regulations, own between $403,023 and $1,201,000 in individual stocks of Big Oil companies, according to a database of personal financial disclosure reports maintained and analyzed by CREW. The vast majority‚Äîup to $1,106,000‚Äîof the Big Oil stock held by senators is held by Republicans.¬†
Five of the ten senators who hold Big Oil stocks sit on committees tasked with environmental protection, climate issues and oversight of the agencies responsible for addressing the climate crisis.¬†
While sitting on committees tasked with environmental protection or the climate makes the conflict of interest inherent in holding Big Oil stock as a U.S. senator more glaring, every senator has opportunities to vote on legislation that impacts Big Oil profits. For example, nine out of the ten senators who hold Big Oil stock voted on last summer‚Äôs Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which the White House calls ‚Äúthe most significant action Congress has taken on clean energy and climate change in the nation‚Äôs history.‚Äù The bill passed along party lines.¬†
Senator Jerry Moran, a Republican from Kansas, reported holding the most Big Oil stock, with between $119,006 and $360,000 in Exxon and Chevron. Over the years, Moran has been a vocal critic of climate regulation; he voted to deny that human actions cause climate change, voted against the IRA, criticized the Green New Deal and promoted the Keystone XL fossil fuel pipeline. Moran serves on the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, which has jurisdiction over oceans, weather, climate change and natural disasters.¬†
Nebraska Republican Senator Pete Ricketts also has a large Big Oil portfolio, and his is quite diversified. Ricketts holds stock in five different companies, with between $100,001 and $254,000 in Chevron, Exxon, Phillips 66, Valero and ConocoPhillips. Ricketts was just appointed to the Senate in January 2023, but has a record of opposing climate regulations as Nebraska governor, including calling the IRA part of President Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúradical environmental agenda.‚Äù As a member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, which has jurisdiction over environmental and anti-pollution laws and oversees the Environmental Protection Agency, Ricketts is now in a position with particular power over the fossil fuel industry.¬†
The ranking member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, Senator Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia, holds between $32,004 and $130,000 in Exxon, Chevron, Shell and Phillips 66 stocks. She is also a member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee‚Äîputting her in the unique position of serving on both committees most relevant to Big Oil. She‚Äôs used those positions to push back on climate regulations, including recently attempting to kill an EPA clean power plan. She has also drawn scrutiny for introducing legislation that would have approved the Mountain Valley Pipeline, while owning stock in a company behind the project.¬†
Perhaps the most extreme stance on the climate crisis belongs to Senator Tommy Tuberville, a Republican from Alabama, who has expressed a belief that God controls the climate and that the climate crisis is nothing more than ‚Äúa talking point on the left that gives them an opportunity to scream and yell that this country is not going to last for 12 more years.‚Äù Tuberville has significant Big Oil stock holdings, with between $51,002 and $117,000 in Exxon, Marathon and Chevron stocks.
Not every Big Oil stock holder has been hostile to climate protections and regulations. Democratic Delaware Senator Thomas Carper holds between $3,000 and $45,000 in Chevron, Shell and TotalEnergies. Carper has introduced a resolution saying ‚Äúhuman activity during the last century is the dominant cause of the climate crisis‚Äù and as the Chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, played a leading role in‚Ä¶

Biden Stumbles Again With Green Energy Subsidies
Over the past year, US taxpayers have learned that one of the chief lessons of #Bidenomics 101 is doling out billions of dollars in green energy subsidies for wealthy corporations. This was what the trifecta of legislative accomplishments ‚Äì #Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law ‚Äì was all about. President Joe #Biden traveled to Philadelphia, PA, this weekend to again tout Bidenomics and announce several billion dollars in so-called federal investments for #hydrogen projects.
$7 Billion for Green Energy Subsidies
Stumbling twice on a short flight of stairs, President Biden took to the stage to award $7 billion in federal grants across 16 states, from #California to #Pennsylvania, for developing seven regional hydrogen hubs as part of the administration‚Äôs broader decarbonization initiative. What companies will receive some of these green energy subsidies? A range of businesses will be involved, but three of the most prominent names on the list are #Amazon, #Chevron, and #Exxon Mobil, worth a combined $2.2 trillion.
While critics would likely ask why some of the wealthiest corporations in the world need a handout from Uncle Sam, President Biden noted that the giveaway is essentially seed money to help jump-start the production of clean hydrogen by having the critical infrastructure established. Additionally, the total investment in these hubs will reach $50 billion because of the substantial private investment also being made.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to announce one of the largest advanced manufacturing investments in the history of this nation. It‚Äôs all part of my plan to make things in America,‚Äù Biden said.
Of course, the administration‚Äôs latest announcement focuses on clean energy, but observers are omitting one key thing: Green energy subsidies are just more corporate welfare. Politicians are, once again, transferring resources from taxpayers to special interests.
Is Hydrogen the Answer?
Hydrogen is considered a crucial component for achieving the world‚Äôs net zero carbon emissions objective by 2050. Hydrogen emits only water when burned as fuel or inside a fuel cell for automobiles. However, hydrogen production requires an immense volume of energy, meaning that, depending on its source, it might not be as green as its proponents would contend. So, for instance, hydrogen can be produced from natural gas, and this so-called bridge fuel has received enormous criticism from climate activists.
Consider this statement from Maggie Coulter, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity‚Äôs Climate Law Institute, who told the Associated Press: ‚ÄúThrowing billions at hydrogen hubs deepens our dependence on fossil fuels and worsens the climate emergency.‚Äù
Indeed, hydrogen could only be labeled green if new renewable sources are built to power hydrogen output rather than relying on the present grid and other carbon accounting programs. In other words, it might have the same environmental effects as fossil fuels. For now, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation, the world is greenwashing green hydrogen.
Trickle-Down Bidenomics
US administration officials have repeatedly asserted that Bidenomics is about growing the economy from the middle out and bottom up, abandoning the concept of trickle-down economics of the past three decades. However, this pejorative term ‚Äì economic policies that disproportionately favor Corporate America and the 1% ‚Äì can apply to the president‚Äôs economic doctrine.
As Liberty Nation has regularly reported, the White House, state governments, and city officials are spending trillions of dollars on corporate welfare. No one in the Oval Office or inside the Democratic caucus on Capitol Hill wants to admit this because the taxpayer-funded subsidies are allocated to their preferred sectors, mainly green energy.
President Biden has demanded that corporations must pay their fair share while signing over checks to these same entities. Moreover, global leaders, like United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, have called for an end to fossil fuel subsidies. This should be a welcome call to action as long as it includes renewables and green energy. Otherwise, they pick winners and losers, favor one industry over another, and engage in hypocrisy. Leftists are not opposed to corporate welfare. They just want the money to go to another set of special interests for a specific cause. That is Bidenomics 101.

4 of the 5 have recently made it a death penalty offence for any of their people to even talk to a Jew about peace. 
Excluding Iraqi Kurdistan, there are 13 Mbpd from the Gulf which finance Jew-hatred across the world. (Algeria and Libya could also be included and expand the figure by 2.5 Mbpd)
OPEC+ (primarily Israel-friendly Russia and KSA) currently have voluntarily shut-in over 5 Mbpd.
The Russian-Ukraine war sanctions have reduced additional production of millions of barrels per day.
American Shale can easily be ramped up significantly more within a 12-18 month timeline.
Each year more EVs are sold, reducing the need for oil across the world. Making the following observations more germane with each passing month.
The destruction of the Nordstream pipeline, the Houthi droning of KSA Abqaiq oil refinery, the destruction of Ukraine's hydroelectric dams and near destruction of its nuclear reactor, Hezbollah's threats to destroy Israeli's gas rig and nuclear power plant in Dimona all teach us an unmistakable lesson: 
Energy infrastructure is a strategic target for international relations today. As it also was, as many of us watched (or as my classmates participated in) during Desert Storm in 1991 and the Iran-Iraq War from 1980-1988.
The Israeli Air Force and/or Navy can EFFORTLESSLY destroy the entirety of the oil infrastructure that is financing the Jew-hatred directed against our people. 
In a Six Hour War. 
Not a Six DAY War. 
But Overnight.
It is high time that we make it known to the Jew-hating countries and think tanks who wish to block normalization and peace that they have a simple choice to make: 
Normalize via Unconditional Peace with Israel.
Or Starve to Death.
There is no need for the United States to add any additional incentives or to be involved at all. 
In fact, such an action by the IAF - similar to whoever bl up of the Nordstream Pipeline - would greatly increase demand for domestically produced American oil and gas. Although it woulde bcatastrophic for giant oil companies such as Chevron, Shell, BP, Total, Baker-Hughes, and others who facilitate the revenues for the Jew-hating regimes.
This is how power is wielded in the world today.
Overcome your squeamishness and face the ugly truth:
Jewish Lives Will Not Matter Until Judeophobic Hydrocarbons Do Not Matter. Or cease to be available.
Normalise or Starve.
This will probably not happen tonight nor next week nor even this year. And perhaps not even next year. But this is what is on the agenda, which no one has had the chutzpah to say aloud. And which was unthinkable until the exponential advances in American Shale Oil, Solar Power, Electric Vehicles and Hydrogen Electrolysis.
I have followers who are attached to the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of all of the countries involved. 
This is a sincere message: 
Peace and development with Israeli assistance or Starvation is your future.

2039,25/09/2023 17:34:49,"PRESS RELEASE:
NNPC Limited, NCDMB, IOCs SIGN MoU To Reduce Contracting Cycle
In a major boost for the nation‚Äôs oil and gas industry, the NNPC Ltd and the Nigerian Content Development & Monitoring Board (NCDMB) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the International Oil Companies (IOCs) to reduce contracting cycle to an optimal level of not more than 180 working days.
The MoU, which was executed on Monday at the NNPC Towers in Abuja, was a demonstration of NNPC Ltd‚Äôs commitment to the efficiency mandate as enshrined in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which is hinged on developing an industry framework for an optimized contracting cycle.
An optimized contracting cycle is expected to improve the ease of doing business, reduce cost and drive efficiency which will eventually translate to production growth, increased revenues, and ultimately improved profitability.
The MoU is also expected to contribute significantly to the double-digit economic growth rate agenda of the Federal Government and generate tremendous value for all the stakeholders which include investors, companies, host communities and the nation at large.
Key benefits of the framework in the MoU include a reduction of the contracting cycle for open competitive tender, selective tender, and single sourcing tender to 180, 178, and 128 working days respectively compared with the current best effort performance of 327, 333, and 185 working days respectively.
Speaking at the MoU signing, the GCEO NNPC Ltd., Mr. Mele Kyari said signing the agreement heralds exciting times for the nation‚Äôs oil and gas industry and stands as a bold testimony that the Company is plunging into the future of hope, productivity and success. 
Kyari, who was represented at the occasion by NNPC Ltd‚Äôs Executive Vice President, Upstream, Mrs. Oritsemeyiwa Eyesan, added that with oil and gas as the bedrock of Nigeria‚Äôs economy, there is the need to get the contracting process in the Industry right so as to get the economy back on track.
In his remarks, the Executive Secretary, NCDMB, Engr. Simbi Wabote, described the MoU signing as a way forward and a critical step towards enhancing the nation‚Äôs crude oil production.
In their various remarks, the IOCs, represented by the MDs/Country Chairs of Shell, ExxonMobil, Chevron, TotalEnergies and ENI all pledged their commitment and support towards the implementation of the MoU for the benefit of all parties.
The framework is in line with the Nigerian Upstream Cost Optimization Program (NUCOP) and in consonance with Mr. President's directive for NNPC Ltd. and NCDMB to engage the industry with the objective of improving the performance of the petroleum industry. 
The development is also in line with the key mandates of NNPC Ltd under the PIA‚Äôs Article 53 (7) which empowers it to operate as a commercial entity in a profitable and efficient manner, as the National Energy Company.
The mandate for efficiency requires that NNPC Ltd. is committed to working with its partners in ensuring key processes, procedures, and timelines that drive major business activities such as contracting, are structured in a manner that engenders efficiency and drives profitability.

2220,28/08/2023 22:54:12,"As it winds down, I wanted to share some thoughts with regard to #GG18 and some of the controversies that came up in this round, specifically the Shell funding.
First I think division in the Gitcoin community is not good. We need to stay united to achieve the scale of impact we strive for. Despite differences in opinion, the community needs to stay cohesive and avoid splintering.
Second, I believe that those corporations that have caused the climate crisis by prioritizing the maximization of wealth at the expense of the climate, should not be allowed to greenwash. We need to continue holding them to account and demanding they stop destroying the climate. We should not celebrate them even if they donate to good causes.
That being said, we also need to be alive to the fact that there just isn't enough funding in the climate space to sustain the various regenerative projects happening around the world. Many projects are operating with less than optimal funding, and this holds back a lot of progress. In fact, we need many more new projects to be launched if we are to scale impact in time to avert disaster.
We need to find new sources of funding if the impact being targeted is to be at a scale that can turn the tide against climate change. Climate action needs to be scaled up by factors from where it currently is. None of this can happen without new funds flowing into the ecosystem.
Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of time to figure out perfect solutions. At the rate we are going 2 degrees rise in global temperatures is probably already locked in at this point. If we don't take radical action immediately then we will be talking about avoiding a rise of 4 degrees. And by then, with warming feedback loops already activated, it'll be too late.
We need to drastically scale up climate action now. Not in a few years time. And the only way to do that is to find more resources to put into projects. Public goods funding is one great way to raise part of what's required. 
Getting corporates like Shell to contribute to the climate round is another. These corporations make money every time we drive, fly, or even order groceries. Part of those funds should flow back to supporting climate action. 
Oil companies continue to make profits because the world continues to use fossil fuels to drive the economy. Until the day that stops, it's only fair that these companies release some of the profits they make to projects working to fix the mess created by their businesses.
We shouldn't be asking companies like Shell to donate to Gitcoin whatever they wish. We should be demanding that all such companies and their associates dedicate a certain percentage of their profits to funding climate projects. It's the least they can do to stem the damage caused by their actions.
I can understand the point of view of those who reject the funds as being dirty money. I respect the decision of those who have decided to opt out of receiving these funds. I also equally respect the decision of those projects that have opted in. I don't think either one is necessarily wrong, I believe it all comes down to personal opinion.
From where I stand, it feels like we are giving these companies a free pass if we don't demand that they pay for the mess they made to be fixed. If we don't take that money, we are allowing them to go scot-free and pass the cleanup bill to someone else.
If big oil companies like Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, Total, and others were pressured by their consumers to pay for the cleanup of the climate; this would translate to a flurry of projects on the ground as new resources are unlocked. This is particularly the case for the Global South where climate financing is woefully lagging.
Requiring oil companies to pay their part is not synonymous with greenwashing. Nobody is going to be congratulating them for doing what they should have been doing since long ago. Calls for the phasing out of fossil fuels should grow stronger and such companies put under pressure till it happens. We aren't giving them a break and we certainly aren't celebrating them.
What we are saying is that until the day comes when these companies close shop, they should pay up. It's their fault things are where they are ecologically, and thus their responsibility to pay for it to be fixed. If they have grown aware of this and begun taking action through donating to #Gitcoin, I think this is something to be encouraged not the reverse.
With reference to the meme I posted above, I once again want to urge community cohesion. Let's not have a situation where projects that accept Shell funding get castigated or otherwise. The climate space needs tolerance for a wide array of opinions. Nobody has all the answers. And some solutions to current challenges (e.g. the funding gap) may not always be perfect. 
In future climate rounds, I would like to see even more corporations donate as a way of paying climate reparations. These new resources will fund a wave of innovation and regeneration across the globe, allowing timely interventions to a fast-deteriorating situation.
In conclusion, I want to pass a round of thanks to the entire @gitcoin team for another successful round. I also wish to thank the Gitcoin community including both the grantees and donors for coming together to build and fund what matters.

Gold eases as US dollar jumps & spotlight on Powell speech
Gold, silver, platinum eye best weeks since July 14
Palladium set for second consecutive weekly fall
SPDR Gold Trust holdings fall further
By Swati Verma
(Reuters) -Gold prices edged lower on Friday as the U.S. dollar reclaimed a 2-1/2-month peak, but the metal was headed for its best week in six ahead of a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that could offer clues on the interest rate outlook.
Spot gold eased 0.2% to $1,913.10 per ounce by 0527 GMT, while U.S. gold futures GCcv1 shed 0.3% to $1,941.30.
Gold has risen about 1.3% so far in the week, which could be its first week of gains this month, as prices climbed to their highest since Aug. 10 on Thursday.
""The false break of $1,900 has provided a nice rally to the $1,920 area, but Powell has the ability to send gold back down to $1,900 as much as he could send it to $1,940,"" said Matt Simpson, a senior analyst at City Index.
""The stronger U.S. dollar is clearly acting as a headwind for gold.""
The U.S. dollar raced for its sixth straight weekly gain, making bullion more expensive for overseas buyers. USD/
Two Fed officials on Thursday tentatively welcomed a recent jump in bond market yields, while noting they see a good chance that no more interest rate increases will be needed. US/
For more rate clues, investors will focus on Powell and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde's speeches expected later in the day at the annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
The main theme will be ""higher for longer"" at Jackson Hole, with Fed officials indicating either tighter policy may be necessary, or a longer plateau is required, according to Nicholas Frappell, global head of institutional markets at ABC Refinery.
Among other metals, spot silver edged 0.4% lower to $24.05 per ounce and platinum was steady at $932.60. Palladium fell 0.7% to $1,232.13.
Silver and platinum were headed for their best weeks since July 14. Palladium was set for a second straight weekly decline.

Copper falls as firm dollar weighs
(Reuters) - Copper prices declined on Friday as a strong dollar made greenback-priced metals more expensive to holders of other currencies.
Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange CMCU3 fell 0.1% to $8,355 per metric ton by 0344 GMT, while the most-traded October copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange SCFcv1 shed 0.5% to 68,780 yuan ($9,438.08) a ton.
The U.S. dollar rose to its highest in more than two months and was on course for its sixth straight week of gains as markets awaited a speech from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to gauge the country's monetary policy path.
SHFE aluminium SAFcv1 fell 0.2% to 18,635 yuan, nickel SNIcv1 eased 0.1% to 169,230 yuan, lead SPBcv1 declined 0.5% to 16,370 yuan, tin SSNIcv1 lost 1% to 215,640 yuan while zinc SZNcv1 rose 0.6% to 20,535 yuan.
LME zinc CMZN3 fell 0.7% to $2,378 a ton, lead CMPB3 declined 0.6% to $2,170.50, tin CMSN3 lost 0.7% to $25,700, while aluminium CMAL3 rose 0.1% to $2,159 and nickel CMNI3 advanced 0.4% to $20,915.
On a weekly basis, both copper contracts are set to gain on China's efforts to stabilise the yuan and on hopes of improving demand ahead of a peak consumption season. LME copper is on track for its best weekly increase in a month.
However, poor economic data from China continued to pressure the demand outlook and prices.
SHFE tin was set for its best week since July 7. Despite weak demand, supply pressure is rising after Myanmar banned ore mining from August.

Iron ore resumes SGX rally on bets over China's near-term demand
By Enrico Dela Cruz
(Reuters) - Iron ore resumed its rally in Singapore on Friday, putting it on track for its biggest weekly gain in 11 weeks, underpinned by China's policy support for its faltering economic recovery and optimism over demand prospects in the near term.
Though little changed on the Dalian Commodity Exchange, the steelmaking ingredient's Chinese benchmark was also poised to log a similar weekly milestone, ahead of a seasonal pick-up in domestic construction activity from September to October.
""As we enter the seasonally bullish Sept/Oct onshore season we are of the opinion dips will find support,"" Al Munro at broker Marex said in a note.
Iron ore's benchmark September contract on the Singapore Exchange SZZFU3 was up 1.5% at $113.60 per metric ton, as of 0340 GMT, after Thursday's 1.2% decline that followed a five-session rally. It has gained more than 6% this week.
Dalian's most-traded January iron ore ended morning trade 0.1% higher at 823 yuan ($112.93) per ton, after swinging back and forth.
Spot iron ore has also climbed more than 6% this week, trading at a four-week high of $116.50 on Thursday, SteelHome consultancy data SH-CCN-IRNOR62 showed.
Support for iron ore was intact despite a Mysteel consultancy report saying some mills in China's steelmaking hub of Tangshan city have suspended sintering operation for one week from Aug. 24 as required to improve air quality.
China is aiming to achieve a supply and demand balance in its steel market this year, according to the industry ministry, even as the market faces mounting pressure from a floundering economy and ongoing property market woes.
Other steelmaking ingredients on the Dalian exchange fell following recent gains, with coking coal DJMcv1 and coke DCJcv1 down 1.2% and 1%, respectively.
Steel benchmarks in Shanghai also dipped. Rebar SRBcv1 and hot-rolled coil SHHCcv1 both dropped 0.5%, wire rod SWRcv1 shed 0.2%, and stainless steel SHSScv1 lost 1.1%.

Wheat Futures Fall on Scant News About Black Sea Corridor -- Daily Grain Highlights
By Kirk Maltais
-- Wheat for December delivery fell 1.3% to $6.31 3/4 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade on Thursday as traders decided to sell with no new developments on insuring Black Sea shipping vessels emerging.
-- Corn for December delivery fell 0.5% to $4.88 1/4 a bushel.
-- Soybeans for November delivery rose 0.8% to $13.71 3/4 a bushel.
HIGHLIGHTS
Scarce News: Grain traders are anxious to learn more information about what a proposal enabling continued shipments out of Ukraine will look like, but don't have details. This allowed futures to slip, particularly wheat.
""There is no clear picture of the Russian market and there was no fresh news on the Ukraine insurance scheme,"" said Steve Freed of ADM Investor Services in a note. ""There is little specific fresh news, and the trade now awaits next week's Stats Canada crop update.""
A Little Better: Corn and wheat futures were pressured in by conditions from the Pro Farmer Midwest Crop Tour improving over last year, particularly for corn. In Illinois, corn yields were estimated at 193.72 bushels an acre, up 1.6% from last year and up 0.8% from the prior three-year average.
Soybean pods counted in a three foot-by-three foot square averaged 1,270.8 pods, up 1.7% from last year and 0.9% higher than the previous three years.
Downside Potential: While soybean pod counts reported by Pro Farmer this week are mostly higher, futures were supported by lingering uncertainties.
""I think from a 'mystery' standpoint, it's all about beans,"" said John Payne of Hedgepoint Global.
Because soybeans are largely planted later in the spring than corn, much of the U.S. soybean crop is still in development, meaning a new stretch of unfavorable weather in the coming weeks could derail U.S. soybean output.
INSIGHT
In Demand: Export sales of U.S. soybeans for the week ended Aug. 17 beat the high end of expectations by analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.
The USDA said 1.58 million metric tons of soybeans were sold in the 2022-23 and 2023-24 marketing years, beating the range of 800,000 tons to 1.3 million tons forecast by analysts.
Corn and wheat sales fell within analyst expectations, totaling 650,800 tons and 406,000 tons, respectively, across both marketing years.
The higher soybean figure was supportive for those futures, but corn and wheat futures fell as the perception of weak export demand was left unchanged.
Growing Patchwork: The latest data from the U.S. Drought Monitor shows a much wider swath of Texas and Louisiana experiencing extreme or exceptional drought conditions, which may present the biggest threat to cotton growing in the South.
However, portions of Iowa and Minnesota also grew more severe in their moisture deficiency, which may have an impact on corn crops heading for the finish line and soybeans still in development.
AHEAD
-- The CFTC is scheduled to release its weekly Commitments of Traders Report at 3:30 p.m. EDT Friday.
-- The USDA is due to release its weekly grains export inspections report at 11 a.m. EDT Monday.
-- The USDA is scheduled to release its weekly crop progress report at 4 p.m. EDT Monday

GRAINS-Wheat rises as hot and dry weather raises supply risk, soybeans firm

(Reuters) - Chicago wheat prices rose on Friday, as hot and dry weather in the United States and other key exporting countries raised the prospect of lower yields.
Soybeans gained ground and were poised for a second straight weekly rise as adverse weather is likely to trim U.S. output.
For the week, soybeans are up almost 2% while corn and wheat are down.
The U.S. spring wheat crop is suffering, with dry weather in the northern Plains likely to reduce yields.
Argentina's current wheat crop needs precipitation in the coming days across key farmland in order to stave off a hit to yields, a weekly report from the Buenos Aires Grains Exchange showed on Thursday.
Prolonged heat across many Ukrainian regions has dried the upper soil level, creating unfavourable conditions for the forthcoming winter grain sowing, analysts at APK-Inform quoted state weather forecasters as saying on Thursday.
The European Commission further reduced its outlook for European Union production of major cereal and oilseed crops this season, with maize seeing the sharpest reduction.
The commission lowered its forecast for 2023/24 EU usable maize production to 61.7 million metric tons (mmt) from 63.0 mmt projected in July. It cut its forecast for 2023/24 usable soft wheat to 126.1 mmt from 126.4 mmt in July.
In the soybean market, forecasts of hot and dry weather raised crop concerns.
Soybeans are susceptible to extreme temperatures with a lack of rainfall forecast for the next several weeks. The crop is at its crucial stage of development.
This week's Midwest crop tour has generally shown soy and corn potential above last year's but mixed levels compared with the average of recent years.
Minnesota's soybean yield potential fell to the lowest in four years as dry weather withered crops in the country's third-largest grower of the oilseed, scouts on an annual crop tour of top U.S. producing states found on Thursday.
However, Illinois soybean pod counts and corn yield prospects are above last year and the three-year average, scouts on an annual Midwest crop tour found on Wednesday, limiting gains.
Commodity funds were net buyers of CBOT soybean and soymeal futures contracts, and net sellers of corn, wheat and soyoil futures contracts on Thursday, traders said.

Australia union threatens strikes at Chevron LNG facilities
By Renju Jose and Lewis Jackson
(Reuters) - Unions at Chevron's (CVX.N) liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities in Australia warned on Friday that work stoppages could cost the U.S. energy major billions of dollars if demands over wages and conditions were not met.
The warning came even as workers at a nearby Woodside facility voted to approve a deal struck by the same unions.
Workers on Thursday voted to authorize the Offshore Alliance of unions to call a strike at Chevron's Gorgon and Wheatstone projects.
The North West Shelf along with the Gorgon and Wheatstone projects account for about one-tenth of global LNG supplies.
In a Facebook post on Friday, the union alliance said of Chevron's senior management team: ""Their stupidity is about to cost them $billions in lost production and profit.""
The unions also criticised the company for putting a proposal directly to a worker vote without going through the bargaining process, and the unions threatened industrial action.
Chevron did not immediately respond to a request seeking comments outside normal business hours.
More than 99% of some 450 workers voted in favour of a authorizing a strike, which could include refusing to load tankers or vessels, bans on certain tasks and a full strike.
Results of another strike ballot for workers at a separate Wheatstone facility are due on Monday afternoon.
The Offshore Alliance, which combines the Maritime Union of Australia and Australian Workers' Union, must give Chevron seven working days' notice before a strike.
Any strike would have forced Asian buyers to outbid Europe to attract gas cargoes. China and Japan are the top two lifters of Australian LNG, followed by South Korea and Taiwan.
Energy analyst Saul Kavonic said Chevron could face some ""low-level"" industrial action but that was unlikely to significantly disrupt supplies.
""The public rhetoric will once again ramp up as the Chevron negotiations get underway, as a normal part of the Australian union bargaining process,"" he said.
WOODSIDE STRIKES A DEAL
The escalation comes a day after the Offshore Alliance reached an in-principle agreement at Woodside's () North West Shelf LNG facility, Australia's largest, triggering a sharp fall in Dutch and British wholesale gas prices on Thursday.
The Offshore Alliance announced on Friday that workers had ""overwhelmingly endorsed"" the draft agreement in a meeting the previous evening. No strike action would take place while the agreement was finalised and put to a second formal vote.
The deal, which will be finalised and sent to the unions on Monday, ""significantly"" increases worker pay, prevents Woodside replacing workers with labour hire or contractors and will require a majority vote of employees for any roster changes, the unions said in a statement.

Nat-Gas Prices Move Higher On Hot Temps In Texas
Rich Asplund - Barchart
July Nymex natural gas (NGN23) on Monday closed up +0.012 (+0.53%).
July nat-gas Monday recovered from early losses and posted modest gains on forecasts for hotter-than-usual temperatures this week in Texas, the largest nat-gas consuming state.¬† Nat-gas prices Monday initially moved lower after updated U.S. weather forecasts shifted milder, signaling nat-gas demand from electricity providers will decline on the reduced need to power air conditioning.¬† Forecaster Atmospheric G2 said below-normal temperatures are expected through next week across most of the eastern and western U.S. states.
Nat-gas prices fell sharply starting in December and posted a 2-3/4 year nearest-futures low (NGK23) Apr 14 as abnormally mild weather across the northern hemisphere this past winter eroded heating demand for nat-gas.¬† January was the sixth-warmest across the contiguous 48 U.S. states in data from 1895.¬† This winter's warm temperatures have caused rising nat-gas inventories in Europe and the United States.¬† Gas storage across Europe was 72% full as of June 10, well above the 5-year seasonal average of 55% full for this time of year.¬† Nat-gas inventories in the U.S. were +16.1% above their 5-year seasonal average as of June 2.
Lower-48 state dry gas production on Monday was 100.8 bcf (+3.9% y/y), moderately below the record high of 101.7 bcf posted on Apr 23, according to BNEF.¬† Lower-48 state gas demand Monday was 66.9 bcf/day, up +3.6% y/y, according to BNEF.¬† On Monday, LNG net flows to U.S. LNG export terminals were 11.7 bcf, up +0.2% w/w.¬† On Apr 16, LNG net flows to U.S. LNG export terminals rose to a record 14.9 bcf/day as nat-gas exports continue to increase from the Freeport LNG terminal as the terminal was partially reopened after being closed since last June because of an explosion.
A decline in U.S. electricity output is bearish for nat-gas demand from utility providers.¬† The Edison Electric Institute reported last Wednesday that total U.S. electricity output in the week ended June 3 fell -5.2% y/y to 76,617 GWh (gigawatt hours).¬† Also, cumulative U.S. electricity output in the 52-week period ending June 3 fell -0.3%¬† y/y to 4,086,219 GWh.
Last Thursday's weekly EIA report was neutral for nat-gas prices since it showed U.S. nat gas inventories rose +104 bcf, below expectations of +114 bcf but above the five-year average for this time of year at 100 bcf.¬† Nat-gas inventories as of June 2 are +16.1% above their 5-year seasonal average.
Baker Hughes reported last Friday that the number of active U.S. nat-gas drilling rigs in the week ended June 9 fell by -2 to a 15-month low of 135 rigs, moderately below the 3-1/4 year high of 166 rigs posted in the week ended Sep 9.¬† Active rigs have more than doubled from the record low of 68 rigs posted in July 2020 (data since 1987).

Oil set for 2nd weekly fall on firm dollar as supply worries ebb
By Muyu Xu
(Reuters) - Oil was headed for a second week of declines even as it rose on Friday, as the dollar firmed before a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell while concerns over tight supply eased.
Brent crude rose 39 cents, or 0.5%, to $83.75 a barrel by 0624 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was also up 39 cents, or 0.5%, at $79.44 a barrel.
For the week, crude prices are set to fall between 1.2%-2.2%, a second consecutive week of decline.
""No doubt the Fed's policy outlook will be the key driving force for markets ahead,"" said Yeap Jun Rong, market analyst at IG.
""With fresh updates on U.S. inflation and labour market data after the previous FOMC meeting, focus will be on what factors the Fed Chair will have his attention on,"" he said.
Investor caution ahead of Powell's remarks at the Jackson Hole Symposium lifted the safe-haven dollar to a 10-week high, its biggest rise in a month, as markets waited for word on how long rates would stay elevated.
A strong dollar makes oil more expensive for holders of other currencies, denting demand.
On the supply side, talks between Turkey and Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan regional government on northern Iraqi crude oil exports are still going on after officials failed to reach an agreement to restart oil exports earlier this week.
Turkey stopped Iraqi oil flows via the Ceyhan port on March 25 after losing a long-standing arbitration case brought by Iraq.
The market is closely monitoring the flows of Iranian oil as the country's crude oil output will reach 3.4 million bpd by the end of September, Iran's oil minister was quoted as saying by state media, even though U.S. sanctions remain in place.
Further weighing on market sentiment, U.S. officials are drafting a proposal that would ease sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector, allowing more companies and countries to import its crude oil.
Norway's Equinor (EQNR.OL) said on Friday it has started production at its extended Statfjord Ost field six months ahead of schedule and expects output to rise by 26 million barrels of oil equivalent.
""The support to oil prices from previous production cuts has ebbed. The market is looking for Saudi Arabia to continue extending its voluntary output reductions,"" said analysts from Haitong Futures.
Analysts estimated that the top oil exporter will likely roll over a voluntary oil cut of 1 million barrels per day for a third consecutive month into October, amid uncertainty about supplies and as the kingdom targets drawing down global inventories further.",neutral,3,0,8349,8349,667,Chevron,0.08313168957829475,neutral
